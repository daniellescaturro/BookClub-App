Project-2 Proposal - BookClub App (working title)

Concept
  Problem - I enjoy reading and discussing books and am part of a book club, but don't always have time to attend. Or at times, I read the book well in advance of the meeting and have a hard time remembering what the book was about or my thoughts on it.

  General App Idea/Purpose - An app to track the books I've read and my comments on them. A stretch goal is to include other users and to create a discussion feature for those who want to discuss books online.

  Who Would Use the App - Readers / Book lovers / Those that want to discuss books online

High-Level Outline
  -Landing page would be index page with nav bar (add a new book) and clickable book covers that direct the user to the show page.
  -Show page would include book cover, date read, rating, synopsis, link to add comments, display of those comments, link to edit book, and button to delete book
  -Page to add new book
  -Page to edit book

Stretch Goals
  -Add users and passwords
    --To do this would have to add a home page for log in and then upon log in, direct user to index page
  -Add capability for multiple users to comment on a book
  -Use partials
  -Styling with Bootstrap or other CSS framework
  -API to pull books into the database, use a route and pull only one time
